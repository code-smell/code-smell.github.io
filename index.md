# Template for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects

Most web applications are changed and adapted quite frequently and quickly. Their environment, for example the size and the behaviour of the user base, are constantly changing. What was sufficient yesterday can be insufficient today. Especially in a web environment it is important to monitor and continuously improve the internal quality not only when developing, but also when maintaining the software.

Jenkins is the leading open-source continuous integration server. Thanks to its thriving plugin ecosystem, it supports building and testing virtually any project.

The goal of this project is to provide a standard template for Jenkins jobs for PHP projects.

Simply follow these four steps to get started:

1. Install the required Jenkins plugins and PHP tools
2. Orchestrate the PHP tools using Apache Ant
3. Configure the PHP tools for use with Jenkins job template
4. Create a Jenkins job for your PHP project
