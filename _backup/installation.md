# Installation

## Prerequisites

You should be able to install the needed tools on your computer. On my MacBook I'm using the helpful [Homebrew][homebrew] which makes the installation of applications and command line tools very easy.

### Ant

We are going to use [Apache Ant][ant] as the build system. Alternatively you could also use [Phing][phing], a possible alternative to Ant, but written in PHP itself.

### Git

You should have a version control system like [Git][git] or [Apache Subversion][subversion] (Git preferred). And why not join [GitHub][github]? GitHub is one of the best web-based Git repository hosting services.

## Jenkins

The installation of [Jenkins][jenkins] is straight forward. After finishing the installation process you can access Jenkins' web backend with `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Recommended Jenkins Plugins

You need to install the following plugins for Jenkins.

- [Checkstyle][jkCheckstyle] for processing logfiles in Checkstyle format, that are generated by PHP_CodeSniffer.
- [Clover PHP][jkCloverPHP] for processing Clover XML logfiles, that are generated by PHPUNit.
- [Crap4J][jkCrap4J] for processing Crap4J XML logfiles, that are generated from PHPUnit.
- [DRY][jkDRY] for processing logfiles in PMD-CPD format, that are generated by PHPCPD.
- [HTML Publisher][jkHTMLPublisher] for publishing documentation generated by phpBox.
- [JDepend][jkJDepend] for processing logfiles in JDepend format, that are generated by PHP_Depend.
- [Plot][jkPlot] for processing CSV outputs generated by PHPLOC.
- [PMD][jkPMD] for processing logfiles in PMD format, that are generated by PHPMD.
- [Violations][jkViolations] for processing various logfiles.
- [Warnings][jkWarnings] for processing warnings in the console log, that are generated by the PHP compiler.
- [xUnit][jkXUnit] for processing JUnit XML logfiles that are generated by PHPUnit.
- [Phing][jkPhing] as a possible alternative to Apaches Ant.

You can install these plugins by using the web frontend or [Jenkins CLI client][jkCLI].

## Recommended PHP Tools

You need to install the following PHP tools.

- [Composer][composer] is the one and only dependency manager for PHP.
- [PHP_CodeSniffer][PhpCodeSniffer] tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.
- [PHPUnit][PhpUnit] is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
- [PHP Copy/Paste Detector][PhpCD] is a Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) for PHP code.
- [phpDox][PhpDox] PHP Documentation Generator is a documentation generator for PHP projects. This includes, but is not limited to, API documentation.
- [PhpDepend][PhpDepend] can generate a large set of software metrics from a given code base. These values can be used to measure the quality of a software project and to identify the parts of an application where a refactoring should be applied.
- [PHPLoc][PhpLoc] PHPLOC is a tool for quickly measuring the size of a PHP project.
- [PHPMD][PhpMd] PHP Mess Detector is a source code analyzer.
- [Phing][phing] Phing is a PHP project build system or build tool based on â€‹Apache Ant.

I assume that you have installed these PHP tools globally. Once you have installed Composer the installation of the other PHP tools is very easy. Simply execute the following command to globally install PHPLOC for example.

~~~bash
composer global require phploc/phploc
~~~

Alternatively you have to ensure that these tools are on the `$PATH` and can be invoked with `phpunit`, `phpcs`, `phploc`, `pdepend`, `phpmd`, `phpcpd`, and `phpdox` respectively.
